## Abstract

Moving object tracking is a fundamental task in video satellite technologies. Existing methods typically introduce unnecessary computational overhead of redundant regions in spatial dimension and struggle to tackle the temporal challenges posed by the coupled motion of the satellite platform and ground objects. To address these issues, we propose a fully sparse framework with hierarchical spatio-temporal fusion (SPAX). Specifically, SPAX utilizes an object-centric fully-sparse paradigm to reduce computational redundancy by focusing only on foreground regions. Furthermore, we adopt the hierarchical spatio-temporal fusion (HSF) to address the complexity of dual-motion coupling through intra-frame multi-scale feature fusion, inter-frame symmetric feature interaction, and inter-frame asymmetric feature interaction, thereby enabling comprehensive temporal information utilization. Additionally, we propose a plug-and-play Gaussian-based trajectory association (GTA) strategy to mitigate the negative impact of observational drifts and accumulated errors. 
Experiments show that SPAX outperforms previous methods on two popular benchmarks, achieving notable improvements of **5.1%** and **8.7%** on MOTA. While achieving the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, SPAX reduces GFLOPs by **88.6%** and delivers a **2.7x** speedup on SatVideoDT dataset, along with up to a **3.1x** acceleration on SatMTB-MOT dataset compared to our baseline.
